## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vpwebdev/freecssdesigns-templates.git
cd freecssdesigns-templates
```

### 2. Open any template

Each template lives in its own directory. Open the `index.html` file directly in your browser:

```bash
# Example: open the Sushi Omakase template
open sushi-omakase/index.html
```

Or use a local dev server:

```bash
npx serve .
```

### 3. Customize and deploy

Swap out the content, colors, and images. Deploy anywhere — Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or any static host.

## Project Structure

Templates use one of two patterns:

**Single-file** — everything in one `index.html` with inline CSS:

```
template-name/
  index.html
```

**Multi-file** — modular CSS architecture with separate pages:

```
template-name/
  index.html
  pages/
    about.html
    contact.html
    ...
  styles/
    variables.css
    base.css
    layout.css
    components.css
    pages.css
  scripts/
    main.js
```

---

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** — semantic markup
- **CSS3** — custom properties, grid, flexbox, animations
- **Vanilla JS** — scroll reveals, mobile nav, interactivity
- **Zero frameworks** — no React, no Tailwind, no Bootstrap
- **Chart.js** — used in Social Dashboard for data visualization (only external library)
